# Technical Documentation page

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/massivemike8/pen/KKpJjEr](https://codepen.io/massivemike8/pen/KKpJjEr).

This project project looks to document information regarding javaScript, which is a central theme in the next module .
***
### Why the project is useful
By using an interactive navbar element on the left, users can jump to the different sections of the page. In the main section, the page features the bulk of information in paragraphs, while code is also presented. Finally, by hovering over the navbar element, the border radius becomes rounded. The project then demonstrates how to develop a technical documentation page.

### How you can get started with the project
